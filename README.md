# 2021_fMRI_Corruption
## This repository collects data and codes of the fMRI project "the neural basis of corruption in power-holders"
### The "data" folder contains the following:
#### The merged behavioral data (./behavior) and simulated data using winning model (./behavior/winmodel_simulation) 
#### The second-level results of the GLM & gPPI results (./fMRI/GLM&gPPI) 
#### The fMRI data for multivariate analyses (./fMRI/MultivariateAnalyses)
#### All roi data for plots (./fMRI/roi)

### The "code" folder contrains the following:
#### R code for model-free behavioral analyses and plots (./code/Corr_behav_v4.R) 
#### R and rstan codes for model-based analyses and plots (./code/model-related)
#### R codes for making roi plots (./code/fMRI_roi_figures)

#### The fMRI analyses were performed using SPM12 (https://www.fil.ion.ucl.ac.uk/spm/software/spm12/), CANlab (https://github.com/canlab/CanlabCore), and nltools (https://neurolearn.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)
